Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install LIVVkit via pip simply use:

.. code:: sh
    
    pip install livvkit

If you wish to get a copy of the source you can clone our Github repo:

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit.git

LIVVkit was designed to be used with `Python
XXX <https://www.python.org/>`__. If you are using any other version of
Python by default, use the command for Python XXX in place of any calls
to ``python`` in this document (or any other LIVVkit Documentation). If
you are not sure what version of Python you are running try running
``python --version`` from a terminal.

If you are having any troubles with dependencies, open an issue on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues>`__!

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~
LIVVkit can be controlled via options specified at the command
line. To see the full list of options, run:

.. code:: sh

    livv.py -h

after installing via `pip` or

.. code:: sh

    python livv.py -h

if you are running from a cloned repo.
