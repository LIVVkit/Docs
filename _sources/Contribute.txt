Below are some links with information to help you contribute to LIVVkit.
Feel free to open an issue in the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit/issues>`__ if you would like
to suggest features, request tests, discuss contributions, report bugs,
ask questions, or contact us for any reason. Want to send us a private
message? See the `contact us <Contact-us>`__ page.

CISM users, if you'd like to add in an existing validation test,
contribute a new one, or suggest future tests, we'd be happy to help.
Validation tests can be developed either publicly or privately depending
on your need. For any communication that can be made publicly, use the
issue tracker; for private communication, see the `contact
us <Contact-us>`__ page.

Other ice sheet model (ISM) users, if you'd like to have your ISM
supported, have a look at the `BATS <build-and-test>`__ documentation
for an idea of how to generate LIVVkit datasets. Open an issue and we'll
help where we can.
